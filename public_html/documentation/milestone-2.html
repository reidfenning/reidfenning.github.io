<p>
    My site will be one page and will consist of the following pages:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Welcome
        <p>
            A short and sweet introduction of my Name and my potential role in Web Development. I don't want to say too
            much because I have all the other sections to elaborate. I will have my LinkedIn, Github and Twitter
            (subject to change) in the navbar.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        About Me
        <p>
            A casual paragraph explaining who I am and what my intention is in the field. I want to go over my
            professional history and relevant coursework. I want to mentioned where I am from and where I currently
            live. I want to mention that I can work solo or as part of a team.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Experience
        <p>
            An unordered list of relevant former occupations and coursework in bootcamp. I will include my college
            degree and possibly my team sports history.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Portfolio
        <p>
            This is where I will showcase the projects I have worked on thus far. I will continue to add projects as I
            complete them.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Contact
        <p>
            This will be my final sections where I will have a contact form. I will have my LinkedIn, GitHub and Twitter
            linked a second time.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
